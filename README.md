# A Beginner’s Journey into HTTP, Load Testing, and Observability

A small learning project created out of **curiosity and experimentation**.

This repository explores how HTTP systems behave in practice when:
- requests pass through a reverse proxy
- the system is stressed by load tests
- behavior is observed through metrics
